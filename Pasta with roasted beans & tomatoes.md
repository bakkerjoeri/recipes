## Instructions

1. In an oven dish combine the cherry tomatoes with olive oil, sliced garlic, salt, fresh rosamary & fresh thyme.
2. In another oven dish combine the beans with olive oil, chopped sage, salt & pepper. (You can also try putting everything in the same oven dish, I haven't tried but maybe it's really nice)
3. Stick both in the oven at 180 degrees celcius for 25 minutes. Stir to turn once halfway. They should blister and brown.
4. Meanwhile cook the pasta!
5. Prepare the sauce: In a medium hot pan add butter & sage to create sage butter. Then add diced onion and fry until glassy. Add pasta salt, pepper, tomato paste & enough pasta water to create a thick but liquid sauce.
6. When the things in the oven are finished add 1/3rd of both the tomatoes and beans to the sauce and mash or blend to make it creamy.
7. Add the pasta to the sauce & mix together.
8. Serve the pasta with the rest of the tomatoes and beans on top.
