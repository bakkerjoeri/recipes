## Instructions
1. Mix your levain. Let it rest until it doubles in size.
2. Mix all your dough ingredients. Let it rest for 45 minutes. Alternatively, you can mix your dough ingredients except the salt and levain early to give it some extra fermentation time. Then mix in the levain and salt once the levain has matured.
3. Do 4 stretch-and-folds over 45-minute intervals.
4. Preshape your loaves.
5. Bulk ferment them in the fridge overnight.
6. With a dutch oven inside preheat your oven at 240 degrees celcius.
7. Score and bake your loaves for 25 minutes with a lid at 240 degrees and minutes without lid at 220 degrees.
