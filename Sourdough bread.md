	* 50% starter
	* 50% all-purpose flour

## Instructions
1. Mix your levain. Let it rest until it doubles in size.

3. Do 4 stretch-and-folds over 45-minute intervals.
4. Preshape your loaves.
5. Bulk ferment them in the fridge overnight.
6. With a dutch oven inside preheat your oven at 240 degrees celcius.
7. Score and bake your loaves for 25 minutes with a lid at 240 degrees and 20 degrees without lid at 220 degrees.
