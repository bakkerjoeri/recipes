## Ingredients
- â…“ cup olive oil
- 4 scallions (or green garlic), white and light green parts, thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro (leaves and tender stems) or chives, plus more for garnish
- Flaky sea salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 cups labne, full-fat Greek yogurt or sour cream
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

## Instructions
1. Heat the olive oil, scallions, red-pepper flakes and cilantro in a small pot over medium-low heat. Cook, swirling occasionally, until the scallions and red-pepper flakes start to visually and audibly sizzle and frizzle and turn the oil a bright, fiery orange. Remove from the heat, and let cool enough to taste without burning your mouth, then season with salt and pepper.
2. Combine the labne and lemon juice in a medium bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Spoon into a bowl and swirl in the sizzled scallion mixture. Top with extra cilantro, if you like.
