- 1 1/2 pounds mixed mushrooms (like oyster, cremini, shiitake, portobello, chanterelle, etc.), very roughly chopped (if using shiitake or portobello, remove stems)
- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 3 shallots, finely chopped
- 1 carrot, finely chopped
- 1/2 tablespoon tomato paste
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup red wine
- 4 cups vegetable, mushroom, chicken, or beef stock
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon hot or sweet paprika, depending on your preference
- 2 teaspoons coriander
- 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
- Kosher salt, to taste

Instructions

1. Cook the mushrooms: Set the All-Clad 3-Quart Casserole or a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Drizzle ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil in the pan and add a couple handfuls of mushrooms. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan, and try not to move them around too much as they cook; you also don’t need to salt them. Once the mushrooms are golden-brown, set them aside in a bowl. Working in batches, repeat until all the mushrooms are cooked.
2. Add ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil to the empty pan and lower the heat to medium. Cook the shallots and carrot until soft (the shallots should be translucent), for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic to the pan and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until fragrant. Add the tomato paste and stir to combine, cooking for 3 to 4 minutes.
3. Mix in the flour, stirring to coat the vegetables and aromatics in the pan, and cook for about 2 minutes. Then add in the cooked mushrooms, along with all the remaining ingredients up to the balsamic vinegar. Bring the mixture up to a boil on medium-high heat, then lower to a simmer and cook for 50 to 60 minutes. The mushroom stew should thicken and darken in color.
4. Season to taste with kosher salt and garnish with fresh parsley, if you’d like. Serve warm over rice, couscous, mashed potatoes, etc.
